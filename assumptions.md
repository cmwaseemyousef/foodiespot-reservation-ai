# Assumptions & Limitations

- API keys and configuration are managed locally and not exposed.
- Restaurant data in `restaurants.json` is demo/sample, not real-time or production.
- Backend uses a rule-based intent extractor for demo; ready to swap with a real LLM.
- Error handling covers missing info, bad input, and out-of-scope queries.
- Real bookings/payments are not processed.
- Future enhancements: production LLM integration, advanced dialogs, real-time updates, voice/chatbot integrations.
